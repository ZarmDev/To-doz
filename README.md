# Contribution

NOTE: This project uses PLAIN HTML, CSS and Javascript

There is no need to use npm, but you do need liveserver
as this project can't work without it (CORS will block it due to the
import files)

You need VSCode and you need to install liveserver in extensions, then
you just right click index.html and press open liveserver

It's a lot better to create a new branch and use it.

Then submit a pull request.

If you contribute, note to seperate functions in their category 

and to use eventListeners for any functions in HTML (otherwise won't work)

If you need ideas, check bugsfeatures.md
